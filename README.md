# CNN_Based_Image_Processing

## Overview
This project showcases a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image processing workflow, implemented for both CPU and GPU environments. It includes key image processing operations such as preprocessing, convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation, highlighting the efficiency and versatility of CNNs in handling image data.

## Structure
The project is structured into two primary components:

### CPU Implementation
- **Directory: 'cpu_based_image_convolution'**
- **Main File: 'main.cpp'**
- **Description:** Manages image preprocessing, convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation using CPU-based processing techniques.

### GPU Implementation
- **Directory: 'gpu_based_image_convolution'**
- **Main File: 'kernel.cu'**
- **Description:** Mirrors the functionality of the CPU version but employs CUDA for accelerated parallel processing on NVIDIA GPUs.

## Dependencies

- **OpenCV:** Utilized for image loading, preprocessing, and transformations.
- **CUDA Toolkit:** Required for the GPU implementation, enabling parallel processing capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
``` git clone https://github.com/rabiaozkan/CNN_Based_Image_Processing.git ```

### Navigate
Choose the appropriate directory (**'cpu_based_image_convolution'** or **'gpu_based_image_convolution'**) based on the desired implementation.

### Compilation
- **CPU Version:**
``` g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main`pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4` ```

- **GPU Version:**
``` nvcc kernel.cu -o kernel `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4` ```

### Execution
- **CPU: ./main**
- **GPU: ./kernel**

## Usage

Modify the image paths in the source files to use your own dataset. The project processes a batch of images through various CNN stages, producing processed output for each step.
